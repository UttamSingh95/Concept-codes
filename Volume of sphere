Problem Description

You are given a positive integer A denoting the radius of a sphere. You have to calculate the volume of the sphere.

Volume of a sphere having radius R is given by (4 * Ï€ * R3) / 3.

NOTE: Since, the answer can be a real number, you have to return the ceil value of the volume. Ceil value of a real
number X is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to X. """

import math
A = int(input())
volume = ((4 * 3.14159265359) * (A**3))/3
volume = math.ceil(volume)
print (volume)
