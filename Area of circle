Problem Description

You are given a positive integer A denoting the radius of a circle. You have to calculate the area of the circle.

Arae of a circle having radius R is given by (Ï€ * R2).

NOTE: Since, the answer can be a real number, you have to return the ceil value of the area. Ceil value of a real
number X is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to X. """
